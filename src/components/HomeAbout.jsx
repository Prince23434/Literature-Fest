        Literature Fest is a celebration of stories and expression, where emotions find words
        and culture finds its voice. We aim to make RTU Kota not just a technical campus but a
        cultural hub where literature lives and breathes among students. This fest brings back
        the charm of books, poetry, and heartfelt conversations. With stalls featuring diverse
        genres, students can explore new worlds, meet authors, and connect directly with
        publishers. Competitions like debates, storytelling, and poetry provide a platform for
        students to express themselves, shine with confidence, and celebrate their creativity.
        More than just a series of events, Literature Fest is a space where writers, readers,
        and dreamers come together to share ideas and imagination. What stays long after the
        fest ends are the memories made, the courage to express, and the stories we carry
        forward.
